# Archivist

## Features:

- Record **all** attempts: both partial and complete.
- Create segmented runs -- where the failed checkpoints are cut out. Useful for content creators, if you want a near perfect ghost to race against.*
- Save `.Ghost.gbx` files instead of `.Replay.gbx` -- often 10-100x smaller.
- Comprehensive stats for each map played.
- Load local maps, campaign maps, tmx maps, by URL or UID, or the current map.
- Auto-refresh records.
- Exports for other plugins to load maps in Archivist.

`*` These replays are created via game APIs and are readily identifiable -- both visually and via data analysis.
